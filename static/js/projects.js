			It became insanely popular during it’s peak, but as voice assistants became more standard in phones, the hype died down, and it was no longer worth running this service, hence i shut it down.<br/><br/>\

			<b> Why it was shut down: </b> <br/>\
			It was shut-down as before starting the project i thought i’d be able to make up for a lack of community by writing my own robot to submit vine videos in the beginning, but i was sadly wrong, the website never really gained the mass popularity it required to succeed and was shut down; even with the robot to auto curate the funniest vines from Vine.<br/><br/>\
			<b> Achievements: </b><br/>\
			This website was the first service i wrote that was designed with a massive amount of users in mind. It was written with it’s own load balancer that i wrote, this load balancer was able to spin up new servers when the load was too high, and kill servers when the load didn’t call extra servers.'
